The goal of the project was to detect the user intent and classify the user chat into the following categories - food,recharge,support,reminders,travel,nearby,movies,casual and other.

A chat can be classified into multiple categories Ex. “Are there any offers going on?”
This query could belong to all the domains in which transactions are possible ( travel, recharge, food, movies, home services, etc)
Thus it was a Multiclass and multilabel problem.

- Implemented a multi-label classifier using the training data. The classifier tagged all the possible domains (food, support etc) for each query using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random forest algorithms.
- Achieved a label accuracy of 94% and subset accuracy of 74%.
